If its first time using script you have to do following things in mysql.
=> Create 'bank_application' database using create_db() funtion
   Create tables for user. Table1 = 'users' and Table2 = 'bankers' using create_table() function


=> You can do it manually from mysql commandline
 
 And you are ready to go.
